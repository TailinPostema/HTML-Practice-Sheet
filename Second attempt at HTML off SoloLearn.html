	<h1> <center> Hello everyone </center>
	</h1>
	<p> <left> I am creating this basic webpage to practice my coding skills! I will try to talk about my mistakes and other thoughts and tips on here while using the different skills I learn off of SoloLearn!</left> </p>
	<p> <hr width="50%" /> <right> So if the formatting is a little crazy, </right> 
	<center>its because I'm trying to hit all the different techniques! </center> </p>
	<p> <right> Right now I am having issues aligning the text to the right of the page </right>
	</P> 
	<p> <img src="2019-IH-Ireland-Facebook.jpg" height="400px" width="470x" border="5px" alt"" />
	</p>
	<p> <a href= "https://www.target.com/b/wild-fable/-/N-e6p1m"> <img scr="2019-IH-Ireland-Facebook.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
	</p>
	<p> <right> <I> <b> Now I am having issues with linking an image to website and a document </right>
	 	<ul> <center> 
		 <li> <I> <b> but now </li> 
		<li> <I> <b> I know </li>
		<li> <I> <b> how to make </li>
		<li> <I> <b> bulleted and numbered lists </li>
		</center>
		</ul>
	</p>
 	<hr width="70%" />	
	<p> <right> I am going to try this whole right alignment thing again. I worked on SoloLearn but its not working right now </right>
	</p>
	<table border="1">
		<tr border="1">
			<td>one</td>
			<td>two</td>
			<td>three</td>
		</tr>>
	</table>
	<p>
	<I> <center> so I am still having issue with align right, I was struggling with creating the table but after doing some research, I found that in order for the border to come up, there has to be a value for it.
